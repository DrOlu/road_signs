[MakeML](https://makeml.app?from=github_road_signs) is a Developer Tool for Creating Object Detection, Semantic Segmentation and Image Classification Neural Networks without a Line of Code. It's built to make the training process easy to setup. It is designed to handle data sets, training configurations, markup and training processes â€” all in one place.

## Road Signs Object Detection Tutorial
It is a repository for an iOS app that allows to detect different road signs (pedestrian crossing, stop, traffic light and speed limits). It's written in Swift, uses Object Detection Neural Network trained using MakeML app, also uses SwiftOCR framework to distinguish different speed limit signs.
In this project several techniques from production CV Mobile solutions were applied. Here is an example of how the app works:
